### RDFox

[RDFox](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/product) is an in-progress (since it only shows trial or demo version) and should be open source database management system that uses the triplestore, or RDF data model. RDFox is hosted with the in-memory model and Java can access it with the API while Python can use the REST version to access it.
The triplestore data model is focused on the storage and retrieval of triples. It is different from a relational database since triplestore databases are optimized for the storage and retrieval of triples.
